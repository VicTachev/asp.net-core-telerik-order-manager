# ASP.NET Core Telerik Order Manger

This repo is a sample project to support the blog post I’ve written for Telerik called “Displaying data in a consistent format with the Telerik ListView Component for ASP.NET Core” where I demonstrate how to how to implement a ASP.NET Core app and display the date with the Telerik ListView component with Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core and EF Core.

The current project includes components (Kendo().Pager, Kendo().Grid, Kendo().DataSource and others) that are part of the commercial library Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core.

To build the project locally you will need to obtain/use a free trial or commercial license of the product. For more information, you can head over to the Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core product or Telerik UI for ASP.NET Core purchase page.
